# USCIS Dashboard Introduction  

### What Is This?
This is a prototype dashboard for USCIS broken into 2 main panels:

1. **Office Overview**
2. **NAICS Drilldown**

Within each of the panels there is a further information. This information is as follows:

1. Office Overview
	+ **Total USCIS Funds Spent per Fiscal Year**
	+ **Top Contractors within USCIS** 
	+ **Top Business Sectors** 
2. NAICS Drilldown
	+ **Total USCIS Funds Spent per Fiscal Year** 
	+ **Top Contractors within 2-digit NAICS code** 
	+ **Top Contractors within 6-digit NAICS code** 
	
Please see [here] (https://www.sba.gov/contracting/getting-started-contractor/determine-your-naics-code) for a description of what NAICS codes are. Please see [here](https://www.naics.com/search/) or [here](https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/2017NAICS/2017_NAICS_Manual.pdf) for a NAICS code list. 2-digit NAICS codes represent major business or industry sectors. 6-digit NAICS codes provide more detailed classification.

### How To Use This Dashboard

You can search through data using the menu on the left. You can select a range of years from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year 2017 includes data up to March 31, 2017. You can also select a single fiscal year as well by placing the left and right slider on the same year. 

You can also select from any 2-digit NAICS code. and you can enter any 6-digit NAICS code. Please do not enter or select multiple NAICS codes. 

### Future Updates

For the future I'd like to make the following additions to this dashboard:

1. Allow downloading of data
2. Allow user to enter multiple NAICS codes
3. Contractor search capability

I'm also open to any other ideas as well
